      <h2> The Rainbow Connection</h2>
      <p>Why are there so many / Songs about rainbows / And what's on the other side?/ Rainbows are visions / But only illusions / And rainbows have nothing to hide / So we've been told and some choose to believe it / I know they're wrong wait and see</p>

      <h2> It Runs Through Me</h2>
      <p>I love the way it flows / I love the way it grows / There's something in this sound that takes me far / It's like a special song / Can move my mood along / But I cannot say you'll hear through my guitar</p>

      <h2> Robert Andre Glasper</h2>
      <p>Glasper's earliest musical influence was his mother, Kim Yvette Glasper, who sang jazz and blues professionally. She took him with her to club dates rather than leave her son with babysitters. She was the music director at the East Wind Baptist Church, where Glasper first performed in public</p>
